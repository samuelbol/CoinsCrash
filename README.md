```diff
> Important: To ensure you can sustain and recover from potential losses,
> it's crucial to start betting with a bankroll of at least 1,000 bits when your initial bet is set at 1 bit.
> This bankroll size is designed to cover up to 8 consecutive losses,
> allowing you to maintain your strategy and minimize the risk of depleting your funds prematurely.
> Betting with a smaller bankroll may significantly increase the likelihood of loss, especially during extended losing streaks. Always bet responsibly and within your means.
```

## Script Simulation
> Hereâ€™s a simulation of the strategy over 150 rounds to showcase its performance.
